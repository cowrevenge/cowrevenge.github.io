Hello! Konichiwa! I am a technology enthusiast, data center engineer, and programmer living in Tokyo, Japan. My love for computers began in high school, where I started with IC chips and low level circuit board logic developments. This base knowledge only grew over time, allowing me to easily adapt to any programming language when the need arose. As a hobbyist, I have ran and designed game server projects that reached across the world.

Here in Tokyo, I participated and easy passed classes at Code Chrysalis with their JavaScript courses. At work, I created python scripts to reduced time to less than 10% of their original required times due. I worked with Amazon Web Services internal database to create workload projects and out graphical interfaces that other fellow employees could use. This allowed managers to predict where and how many workers to assign in a timely manner instead of after the fact practices that were being used before. Yest driven development, recursion and API interactions are all a normal part of my daily activities.

Today, I'm currently working as network engineer in Odaiba, Tokyo and looking to further my career and skills.
